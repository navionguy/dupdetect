# DupDetect
The problem statement:

We have generated a number of (csv) code files that should be guaranteed to have unique codes (e.g. X59J) not only within themselves, but also among each other.  Write code that can take the names of these files and verify the code uniqueness across all csv files in parallel. Bonus points if you can make it immediately stop itself once it has found a duplicate code.
